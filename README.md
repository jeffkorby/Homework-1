# Homework-1

This homework assignment started out with some initial code for a website. The goal was to go through and update it so that it would have semantic html elements.
Ideally this would help to clean up some of the redundancies in the code as well as making it more user friendly. The html semantic elements help others to know what
are of the website that section of code corresponds with. Additionally we were to add alt text tags to the images to help those people who use a screen reader.
